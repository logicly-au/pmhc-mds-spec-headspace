  :2: No
:Notes:

  1 - Yes
    This code is to be used for service contacts between a mental health service
    provider and the patient/client in whose clinical record the service contact
    would normally warrant a dated entry, where the patient/client is
    participating.
  
  2 - No

    provider and a third party(ies) where the patient/client, in whose clinical
    record the service contact would normally warrant a dated entry, is not
    participating.
  
  *Note:* Where a client intended to participate in a service contact but failed
  to attend, :ref:`dfn-service_contact_participation_indicator` should be recorded
  as '1: Yes' and :ref:`dfn-service_contact_no_show` should be recorded as '1: Yes'.

  practitioner plus the client contribution. In many cases, there will not be a
  co-payment charged and therefore zero should be entered. Where a co-payment

  *Note: NEC is used for 'Not Elsewhere Classified'. For these records, only use these service types if they cannot be classified by any of the other service options.*
  
  0 - No contact took place
    Only use this code where the service contact is recorded as a no show.
  
  1 - Assessment
    Determination of a person's mental health status and need for mental
    health services, made by a suitably trained mental health professional,
    based on the collection and evaluation of data obtained through interview
    and observation, of a person's history and presenting problem(s).
    Assessment may include consultation with the person's family and concludes
    with formation of problems/issues, documentation of a preliminary
    diagnosis, and a treatment plan.
  
  2 - Structured psychological intervention
    Those interventions which include a structured interaction between a
    client and a service provider using a recognised, psychological method,
    for example, cognitive behavioural techniques, family therapy or psycho
    education counselling. These are recognised, structured or published
    techniques for the treatment of mental ill-health. Structured psychological
    interventions are designed to alleviate psychological distress or
    emotional disturbance, change maladaptive behaviour and foster mental
    health. Structured psychological therapies can be delivered on either an
    individual or group basis, typically in an office or community setting.
    They may be delivered by trained mental health professionals or other
    individuals with appropriate competencies but who do not meet the
    requirements for registration, credentialing or recognition as a mental
    health professional. Structured Psychological Therapies include but are
    not limited to:

    - Cognitive-behavioural therapies
    - Relaxation strategies

     Activities focused on working in partnership and liaison with other
     health care and service providers and other individuals to coordinate
     and integrate service delivery to the client with the aim of improving
     their clinical outcomes. Consultation and liaison may occur with primary
     health care providers, acute health, emergency services, rehabilitation
     and support services, family, friends, other support people and carers
     and other agencies that have some level of responsibility for the
     client's treatment and/or well being.
  
  5 - Clinical nursing services
    Services delivered by mental health nurses that cannot be described
    elsewhere.  Typically, these aim to provide clinical support to clients
    to effectively manage their symptoms and avoid unnecessary hospitalisation.
    Clinical nursing services include:
  
    - monitoring a client's mental state;
    - liaising closely with family and carers as appropriate;
    - administering and monitoring compliance with medication;
    - providing information on physical health care, as required and,
      where appropriate, assist in addressing the physical health inequities
      of people with mental illness; and
    - improving links to other health professionals/clinical service providers.
  
  6 - Child or youth-specific assistance NEC
    Services delivered to, or on behalf, of a child or young person that cannot
    be described elsewhere. These can include, for example, working with a
    childâ€™s teacher to provide advice on assisting the child in their educational
    environment; working with a young person's employer to assist the young
    person to their work environment.
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for
    Service Contacts that cannot be described by any other Service Type. It is
    expected that the majority of Service Contacts delivered to children and
    young people can be assigned to other categories.*

    suicide that cannot be described elsewhere. These can include, for example,
    working with the person's employers to advise on changes in the workplace;
    working with a young person's teacher to assist the child in their school
    environment; or working with relevant community-based groups to assist the
    client to participate in their activities.
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
    described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
    Service Contacts delivered to clientâ€™s who have a risk of suicide can be
    assigned to other categories.*
  
  8 - Cultural specific assistance NEC
    Culturally appropriate services delivered to, or on behalf, of an Aboriginal
    or Torres Strait Islander client that cannot be described elsewhere.  These
    can include, for example, working with the clientâ€™s community support network
    including family and carers, menâ€™s and womenâ€™s groups, traditional healers,
    interpreters and social and emotional wellbeing counsellors.
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that cannot be
    described by any other Service Type. It is expected that the majority of
    Service Contacts (see domains below) delivered to Aboriginal or Torres Strait
    Islander clients can be assigned to other categories.*
  
  98 - ATAPS
    Services delivered as part of ATAPS funded referrals that are recorded and/or
    migrated into the PMHC MDS.
  
    *Note: This code should only be used for Service Contacts that are migrated
    from ATAPS MDS sources that cannot be described by any other Service Type.
    It is expected that the majority of Service Contacts delivered to clients
    from 1st July, 2017 can be assigned to other categories.*
  
    This response will not be allowed on service contacts delivered after
    30 June 2018. (All ATAPS referrals should have concluded by that date).
