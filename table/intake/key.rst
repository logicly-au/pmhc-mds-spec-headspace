Intake Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the provider
organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of intake keys in
this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
identified) without having to re-allocate intake identifiers since they can
never clash.

A recommended approach for the creation of Intake Keys is to compute `random
UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.
