The referral date is the date the client was originally referred to an MDS
reporting service. Typically the referral is made by an external (non-MDS)
provider - such as a general practitioner, but it may be another MDS reporting
service or the client themselves.

Where there is a
linked intake and treatment both the Intake and Episode records must use the
same date - ie. the date the client was originally referred.
The referral date is NOT the date that an
intake service refers a client to a treatment organisation. 

For clients who self refer,  the referral date should be the date
the client first contacted the intake service or provider organisation.
For the intake of a client who self referred, the referral date
will be the same as the Date client contact Intake.

For Date fields, data must be recorded in compliance with the standard format
used across the National Health Data Dictionary; specifically, dates must be
of fixed 8 column width in the format DDMMYYYY, with leading zeros used when
necessary to pad out a value. For instance, 13th March 2008 would appear as
13032008.

- The referral date for Intakes must not be before 1st January 2020.
- The referral date for Episodes must not be before 1st January 2014.
- The referral date must not be in the future.

Referral date was optional in specifications prior to Version 4. In Version 4
referral date has been made mandatory. In order to export and re-upload episode data
that was uploaded or entered prior to Version 4 the value '09099999' will be
used in data exports and allowed for existing episode data without a referral date.
See `Episode Validations <https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/validation-rules.html#episode>`_ for rules on
how this value may be used.
