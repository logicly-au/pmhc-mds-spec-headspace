Diagnoses are grouped into 8 major categories (9 for Additional Diagnosis):

- 000 - No additional diagnosis (Additional Diagnosis only)
- 1xx - Anxiety disorders
- 2xx - Affective (Mood) disorders
- 3xx - Substance use disorders
- 4xx - Psychotic disorders
- 5xx - Disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence not listed elsewhere
- 6xx - Other mental disorders
- 9xx except 999 - No formal mental disorder but subsyndromal problems
- 999 - Missing or Unknown

The Principal Diagnosis should be determined by the treating or supervising
clinical practitioner who is responsible for providing, or overseeing, services
delivered to the client during their current episode of care. Each episode of
care must have a Principal Diagnosis recorded and may have an Additional
Diagnoses. In some instances the client’s Principal Diagnosis may not be clear
at initial contact and require a period of contact before a reliable diagnosis
can be made. If a client has more than one diagnosis, the Principal Diagnosis
should reflect the main presenting problem. Any secondary diagnosis should be
recorded under the Additional Diagnosis field.

The coding options developed for the PMHC MDS have been selected to balance
comprehensiveness and brevity. They comprise a mix of the most prevalent mental
disorders in the Australian adult, child and adolescent population,
supplemented by less prevalent conditions that may be experienced by clients of
PHN-commissioned mental health services. The diagnosis options are based on an
abbreviated set of clinical terms and groupings specified in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR). These code
list summarises the approximate 300 unique mental health disorder codes in the
full DSM-IV to a set to 9 major categories, and 37 individual codes. Diagnoses
are grouped under higher level categories, based on the DSM-IV. Code numbers
have been assigned specifically for the PMHC MDS to create a logical ordering
but are capable of being mapped to both DSM-IV and ICD-10 codes.

Options for recording Principal Diagnosis include the broad category ‘No formal
mental disorder but subsyndromal problems’ (codes commencing with 9). These
codes should be used for clients who present with problems that do not meet
threshold criteria for a formal diagnosis - for example, people experiencing
subsyndromal symptoms who may be at risk of progressing to a more severe
symptom level.

Each category has a final entry for capturing other conditions that don’t meet
the more specific entries in the category. This includes the ‘No formal mental
disorder but subsyndromal problems’ category. Code 905 (‘Other symptoms’)
can be used to capture situations where a formal mental disorder has not be
diagnosed, but the symptoms do not fall under the more specific 9XX series
entries. The 905 code should not be used where there is a formal but unlisted
mental disorder. In such a situation code 605 (‘Other mental disorder’)
should be used.

The following responses have been added to allow mapping of ATAPS data to PMHC
format.

- 100: Anxiety disorders (ATAPS)
- 200: Affective (Mood) disorders (ATAPS)
- 300: Substance use disorders (ATAPS)
- 400: Psychotic disorders (ATAPS)

*Note: These four codes should only be used for Episodes that are migrated
from ATAPS MDS sources that cannot be described by any other Diagnosis.
It is expected that the majority of Episodes delivered to clients
from 1st July, 2017 can be assigned to other diagnoses.*

These responses will only be allowed on episodes where the original
ATAPS referral date was before 1 July 2017

These responses will only be allowed on episodes with the !ATAPS flag.
