Practitioner category refers to the labour classification of the service
provider delivering the Service Contact.  Practitioners should be assigned to
the code that best describes their role for which they are engaged to deliver
services to clients. Practitioners are registered in the PMHC MDS by Provider
Organisations, with each practitioner assigned a code that is unique within the
organisation.

In most cases, Practitioner Category will be determined by the training
and qualifications of the practitioner. However, in some instances, a
practitioner may be employed in a capacity that does not necessarily reflect
their formal qualifications. For example, a person with a social work
qualification may be employed primarily as a peer support worker on the basis
of their lived experience of a mental illness.  In such instances, the
practitioner should be classified as a peer support worker.

12 - Psychosocial Support Worker
  Refers to practitioners who are principally employed to provide psychosocial
  support services to clients where the practitioner has specific training in
  the area (e.g., Cert 4 qualification) and cannot be better described by
  another category.

13 - Peer Support Worker
  Refers to practitioners who are principally employed to provide support to
  clients on the basis of the practitionerâ€™s lived experience of mental illness.


**Changes in effect from 1 January 2019**

- Two new codes have been added to the existing Practitioner Category data item,
  to allow for Psychosocial Support Workers (new code 12) and Peer Support
  Workers (new code 13) who are typically employed in psychosocial support programs.
