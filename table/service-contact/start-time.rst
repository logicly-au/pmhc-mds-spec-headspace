Notes: Indicates the time at which the Service Contact began. Time should be
recorded in 24-hour time in the format HH:MM. Leading zeroes are accepted but
not required. For example, 8:30 in the morning could be 8:30 or 08:30 and 3:45
in the afternoon would be 15:45.

The end-of-day flag "24:00" may be used as a missing time value for any
existing Service Contacts that have previously been added to the MDS without
a start time. See Validations for start date are listed at
`Service Contact Validations <https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/validation-rules.html#https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v4/validation-rules.html#service-contact>`_ for rules on
how the end-of-day value may be used.
