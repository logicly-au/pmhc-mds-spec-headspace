New arrangements for some services delivered in primary mental health care
allows clients to refer themselves for treatment. Therefore, 'Self'
is a response option included within 'Referrer profession'.

Where there is a linked intake and treatment, both the Intake and Episode records
must use the same referrer profession - ie the intake service is not the referrer.
