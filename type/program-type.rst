1 - Flexible Funding Pool
  Organisations can use this field for episodes being delivered through all
  other Programs commissioned through Primary Mental Health Care Schedule
  that are not otherwise described by another category. This may include but
  is not limited to general Stepped Care, Mental Health in Residential Aged
  Care Facilities, and Indigenous Mental Health.

2 - Head to Health
  Organisations can use this field for episodes delivered through the Head to
  Health Program. This includes Head to Health Adult Centres and Satellites
  and pop-up clinics.

  NSW and Victorian pop-up clinics data have been identified using the Head
  to Help Version 3 extension and !covid19 tag. Any historical or new records
  that are identified this way will be mapped to this Program Type field
  under the Version 4 specification. The !covid19 tag will remain as a
  reserved tag for the original purpose of indicating that an episode has
  occurred as result of the COVID-19 pandemic once Head to Help Version 3
  extension reaches it’s end of life date.

3 - AMHC
  Organisations can use this field for episodes delivered through the Head to
  Health Program by organisations that were already delivering the Adult
  Mental Health Centre (AMHC) trial sites.

  This change only applies to the following PHNs implementing AMHCs from
  December 2021:

  * West Victoria PHN
  * Northern Territory PHN
  * ACT PHN
  * North Perth PHN
  * Nepean Blue Mountains PHN
  * North Queensland PHN
  * Tasmania PHN

  AMHC data has been identified using the !amhc tag. Any historical records
  created on or before 30 June 2022 that use this tag will be mapped to this
  Program Type under the Version 4 specification. The !amhc tag will be
  removed from future use once PMHC MDS Version 2 specification reaches
  it’s end of life date.

  From July 1 2022 the AMHC trial sites were consolidated under the Head to
  Health program. For data collection purposes, organisations delivering
  Head to Health services that were already delivering AMHC trial sites can
  use either the AMHC or Head to Health program type for records created
  on or after 1 July 2022.

4 - Psychosocial
  Organisations can use this field for episodes delivered through the National
  Psychosocial Support Services Program.

  Psychosocial data has been identified using the Principal Focus of Treatment
  Plan (PFOT) “Psychosocial” category. Any historical or new records that
  utilise the Psychosocial PFOT will be mapped to this Program Type field
  under the Version 4 specification.  The Psychosocial PFOT category will
  no longer be available under the Version 4 specification and further
  guidance will be provided by the Department to support the management
  of this change in data collection requirements.

  Any records that have the Psychosocial PFOT but also have a !covid19,
  !amhc, or !br20 tag will be mapped to the respective Program Type associated
  with those tags rather than the Psychosocial Program Type.

5 - Bushfire Recovery 2020
  Organisations in fire affected communities can use this field for episodes
  delivered through the Australian Government Mental Health Response to
  Bushfire Trauma.

  This data has been identified using the !br20 tag. Any historical or new
  records using this tag will be mapped to this Program Type field under
  the Version 4 specification. The !br20 tag will be removed from future
  use once the Bushfire Program is concluded.
